# Getting Started

The recommended way to edit REAM files is to use [REAM-Editor](https://chmlee.github.io/ream-editor), an editor designed to read and write REAM files.
It runs entirely in the browser and requires no local installation.

A [lite version of REAM-editor](https://github.com/chmlee/ream-editor-lite) is embedded in this documentation for readers to test the examples.
Click the `Try it!` button under each example to toggle the editor.

You can also edit REAM files with any text editor, and use the standalone parser to compile the datasets.
See [reamparser.js](/ream-doc/Toolchain/Parser) for the requirements and installation instructions.
