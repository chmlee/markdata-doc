The recommended way to edit REAM files is to use [REAM-Editor](https://chmlee.github.io/ream-editor), an integrated development environment (IDE) that runs entirely in the browser. No additional installation is needed.

A light version of REAM-editor is embedded in the documentation for readers to test the examples.
Click the `Try it!` button under each example to toggle the editor.

You can also edit REAM files with any text editor, and use the standalone parser to compile the datasets.
See [reamparser.js](/Toolchain/Parser) for the requirements and installation instruction.
