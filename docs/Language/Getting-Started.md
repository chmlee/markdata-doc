# Getting Started

The recommended way to edit Markdata files is to use the [Markdata-editor](https://chmlee.github.io/markdata-editor).
It runs entirely in the browser, and no installation is needed.

You can also edit Markdata files with any text editor, and use the standalone parser to compile the datasets.
See [markdown.js](/Toolkit/Parser) for the installation instruction.
