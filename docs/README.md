REAM is a data serialization standard with Markdown-like syntax.
The language encourages detailed documentation for individual data points, and aims to be the human-readable, modular and reusable "source code" of social science datasets.

Multiple tools build upon the language are under active development to provide a user-friendly workflow to create, edit and distribute REAM datasets, including a [parser](/Toolchain/Parser) that compiles REAM file into analysis-ready format.
See [Toolchain](./Toolchain) for more information.

Though not required, the language and the toolchain is designed to work with [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a distributed version control system for personal and collaborative projects.
[See how REAM works with Git](/Language/Git-Integration)

::: warning NOTE
The project is still at its alpha stage:
features are added and removed constantly, and backward compatibility is not guaranteed.
You are free to play around with the tools, but it's not recommended that you use this for anything serious before it enters beta stage (probably not until summer 2021)
