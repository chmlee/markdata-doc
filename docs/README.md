Markdata is a free and open-source data serialization standard for social science datasets, featuring markdown-like syntax.
The language is designed to be human-readable, modular and reusable "source code" for your datasets.

Multiple tools build upon the language is under development to provide a one-stop solution to create, edit and distribute datasets, including a [parser](#) that compiles Markdata file into analysis-ready format, such as CSV.
See [Toolkit](./Toolkit) for more information.

Though not required, the language is also designed to work with [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a distributed version control system for collaborative project.
