# Toolkit

The following tools are developed around Markdata.
The goal is to provide a user-friendly workflow to create, edit, distribute and reuse Markdata files.

## Alpha Stage

- [Markdata.js](https://github.com/chmlee/markdata.js):
A Markdata parser and emitter written in JavaScript.

- [Markdata Editor](https://github.com/chmlee/markdata-editor):
A graphical editor for Markdata files.

## Planned

- prism-markdata
a prism-based syntax highlighter for Markdata files.

- mppm:
A package and project manager for Markdata files, inspired by python-poetry and cargo.
